# Generative AI for Computer Vision

This repository provides resources and labs to explore the foundations of Generative AI techniques applied to computer vision. It includes practical implementations and comparisons of state-of-the-art generative models.

## Branches

### `lab1`: VAE and GAN
In this lab, you will implement a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct images and explore its latent space. You will also conceptualize and implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to understand their differences and reflect on their respective strengths and weaknesses in generative modeling.
